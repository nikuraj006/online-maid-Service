            <p>

Today in the world of technology we get everything just by sitting at our places 
.But sometimes we don't get everything we want on just a click .We don't get maids 
, servants , gardeners , drivers on just a click ,for that we have to roam around
the area or have to ask to our neighbours for them ,and today no one has time to 
search for maids and all in their area or to ask someone .Suppose a person shifts 
to a new place ,so he wants maids or servants to work at their home ,and it is not
guaranteed that the maid is good at her work .So to overcome this problem we got a 
solution of making a website which will help people in finding good home maids ,cooks 
,drivers ,gardeners .Here ,people will find all the details about the servant they
want and a plus point is that there will be ratings allotted to each servant .So ,
a customer can select the servant on the basis of ratings. Here, the servant can 
also fill his details so ,that when someone will search for servants on the basis 
of category ,his details will also be visible to the customer . By, this employment 
will increase if someone wants to be a servant. A person can choose which type of 
servant he wants without any problem on just a click. After login only, the customer 
can select the servant and will get all the information containing his contact number 
and address.

            <center><h2>Introduction</h2></center>
            <p>
Whenever people shifts from one area to another area, they don’t know much about that area, they are new to the area and no one has time to search for a servant by asking to everyone. So, for that, this is the solution where we can find lots of servants of that particular area. In this project, we will have a database containing four tables for cooks, maids, Gardner and drivers .Here, the interested people can also fill their details if they really want to do the house keeping jobs. The data will then be entered into the database. A customer can choose any one from them, on the basis of ratings. The ratings are given by those people who were the owners of their previous servants. The customer can choose the servants of a particular area by giving the location. The names will then be sort out on the basis of location. The customer will then have all the details of the servant, on the basis of this contact information, he can easily contact to the servant and can ask about his fees and timings. So, this is a very simple way of getting everything on just a click.

Existing Problem</h2></center><p>
In this technical world, we have solution of every problem. But we don’t have a solution to find servants online within a minute. Now days, people find it difficult to find servants because no one is reliable and people don’t have time to search them in their area. It wastes a lot of time in searching or asking to neighbours for servants.
</p><center> <h2>
    Proposed Solution </h2></center><p>
To overcome this problem, we have a very unique idea of making a website that will allow the customers to get cooks; servants etc. on the basis of their ratings. Then customer will then have all the information about the particular servant of that particular area.

           Expected Outcome</h2></center><p>
The expected outcome is that a customer will get all the details about the servant he chooses. 
Once the user is logged in then only he will get all the details about the servant.
A customer can also see the ratings of the servant he chooses, which were given by their
previous or present owner, so that there will an ease of choosing the servant. A customer
can also give his review to servant, which will allow the other customer to choose servants 
wisely. And as the servant can also fill his details so that his details will be there whenever
a customer chooses a particular location.
